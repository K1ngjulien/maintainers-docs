description: How to propose a dependency or installer for publishing in the Bottles repository.

# Publish
If you are here it means that your dependency or installer is working and you 
want to publish it in the official repository and make many users happy. Thanks 
in advance, we are really proud of you and your work, take a break before 
publishing because you deserve it.

## Getting started
Bottles repositories are actually git repositories, so you can use `git` or
any client to manage them.

First of all, you need to fork the repository on GitHub, then add your
manifest to the right folder (like the testing phase). Please **do not update
the index.md file**, it will be done by our team after the review.

After applying your changes, open a Pull Request and wait for a team member 
to proceed with the review.

Your work is done, thanks again!

## Maintainers and reviews
Even though the repository is basically community maintained, we are forced 
to maintain a level of security by having all publications checked by our
team before publishing them. This is because sometimes involuntary or 
(unfortunately) voluntary and harmful mistakes can be made.
